# QuickStayHotel-Booking

A full-stack web application for hotel search and booking, built with React (client) and Node.js/Express (server).

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

- 🌐 Frontend (Client): [https://quickstay-olive.vercel.app](https://quickstay-olive.vercel.app)

## 📱 Test Login (Vercel Deployment)

To test the login system on the deployed version:
